# Algerian-forest-fires-analysis
This project focuses on analyzing the Algerian Forest Fires Dataset to study environmental factors affecting fire occurrence. It includes data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), visualization, and predictive modeling using machine learning to assess forest fire risk.

# Cleaning Process
During the data cleaning process, we identify and remove any null values. The dataset is then divided into two parts based on the region from the 122nd index: Bejaia Region Dataset and Sidi-Bel Abbes Region Dataset. A new column named Region is added, and object-type values are converted to appropriate integer or float types according to the data.
